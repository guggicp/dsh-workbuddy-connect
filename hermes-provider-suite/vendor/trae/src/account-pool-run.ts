/**
 * The pool's two batch actions: check in every account, and test every account.
 *
 * 参考：`dsh-connect-workbuddy` 的 `src/account-pool-run.ts`（同样三条规则：串行、
 *   单账号失败不中断整批、签到先查状态）。本文件的编排与该实现逐条对齐。
 * 改动：Trae 的签到是**按设备**记账的（`did_checked_in` 键在 `x-device-id` 上，
 *   重复领取回业务码 `9095`「该设备今日已参与签到」，docs 实测 2026-09-26），
 *   WorkBuddy 没有这一层，所以这里多出一个 `device-already` 行状态，并且**一旦
 *   撞上 9095 就停止后续账号** —— 继续往下签只会让每个账号都撞上同一面墙，白
 *   发 N 次请求。这与 `probeModelsSequentially` 遇到 `auth` 即中止是同一条理由。
 *
 * 三条固化成代码的规则：
 *
 *   1. **串行，绝不并发。** Trae 的限流按请求体积触发且各账号独立计时；同时打
 *      整池正是把好账号打成 `4011` 的最快方式（`src/model-probe.ts` 已把这条
 *      写进注释：并行探测会制造出本功能最该避免的 `rate_limited`/`unknown`）。
 *   2. **一个账号失败不中断整批。** 批量结果**逐个账号**返回，而不是整体
 *      成功/失败 —— 一个坏账号不能把其余账号的结果一起藏起来。
 *   3. **签到先查状态，已签到就不再发写入请求。** 幂等，避免重复领取，也避免
 *      把一次「已经签过」当成失败。
 *
 * 本模块不持有定时器、不写盘：编排是纯的（依赖注入），因此可被单测直接驱动。

 * silent spend this feature forbids.
 *
 * ONE model for the whole batch, deliberately. Letting each row test a different
 * model makes a green batch UNCOMPARABLE — one account's `ok` on model X and
 * another's on model Y — which is the reading ("all green") that the reference
 * implementation removed its per-account override for. What stays is that every
 * measurement RECORDS the model it probed and each row displays it.
 *
 * Never throws: a failed probe is a ROW, not an aborted batch. A credential
 * rejection does NOT stop the run (unlike the region-wide model test, where every
 * later probe would fail the same way): here each account has its OWN credential,
 * so one account's bad token says nothing about its neighbours.
 *
 * `onRow` fires the moment one account's row exists, which is what lets a caller
 * report progress. The loop is SERIAL by design, so without this a caller cannot
 * say anything until the SLOWEST member answers: one stuck account made a working
 * batch look like a dead button.
