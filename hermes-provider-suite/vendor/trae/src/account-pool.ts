/**
 * The account pool: which local Trae account should be billed, and why.
 *
 * 参考：`dsh-connect-workbuddy` 的 `src/account-pool.ts`（同一套「打分 + 排序 +
 *   挑免费模型」的纯逻辑）。本文件的规则与该实现**逐条对齐**，只在 Trae 上游
 *   确实不同的地方分叉，分叉处都在注释里点名原因。
 * 改动： trae 侧的原料不是「一个积分数」而是 `workAvailable` / `generalAvailable`
 *   两个桶（SOLO 聊天只花 General），快到期原料来自 `TraeWebCredits.expiry`
 *   的分桶（24h/3d/7d），面板有三个（cn / enterprise / ai）而不是两个区域。
 *
 * 本模块只做**纯逻辑**（打分、排序、挑免费模型、判定出池原因），不碰网络、
 * 不碰文件系统，以便单测直接钉住这些规则 —— 它们包含四条猜不出来、必须显式
 * 表达的结论：
 *
 *   1. **`creditMultiplier` 缺失不等于免费。** Trae 国内版的静态 fallback 目录
 *      **整份都没有**该字段（`src/catalog.ts`），所以「没有倍率」在 cn 是常态。
 *      把 `undefined` 当作 0 会让批量测试在首次目录刷新前拿收费模型去跑真实
 *      chat 调用，直接产生用户没预期的开销。
 *   2. **没有免费模型时不回退到收费模型。** 宁可告知「本面板暂无免费模型」，
 *      也不静默换一个收费模型去跑批量测试。
 *   3. **`rate-limited` 只是暂时出池。** 它恰恰是本功能最想利用的状态（模型
 *      本身没问题），当成永久不可用剔除等于把好账号扔了。
 *   4. **快过期的额度排在额度多的前面**（workbuddy issue #70 的教训）：如果
 *      按额度总额优先，一个当天要清零的账号永远排不到，那笔额度必然作废。

 * 2. **Expiring credits first, soonest first.** Points about to expire are worth
 *    exactly zero after they do, so spending them before they lapse is strictly
 *    better than saving them.
 * 3. **Largest expiring amount.** Between two accounts that both have expiring
 *    points, the one with more at risk goes first.
 * 4. **Credits, highest first.** Among accounts with nothing expiring, spend the
 *    one with the most, so a nearly-drained account is conserved.
 * 5. **Freshest credential.** Tie-break so a stale token never wins a draw.
 * 6. **Account id.** Final tie-break, making the order TOTAL: two accounts equal on
 *    every key would otherwise keep the caller's array order, so the same pool
 *    could rotate differently between two runs.
 *
 * WHY EXPIRY OUTRANKS SIZE (workbuddy issue #70). These used to be strict
 * lexicographic keys: total, THEN expiry. Since totals are almost never exactly
 * equal, the expiry rule was unreachable — an account with 196 points lapsing that
 * day ranked LAST behind accounts that expire weeks later, simply because it held
 * ~1,200 fewer points overall. It was never selected, so those points always
 * lapsed. A "use it or lose it" rule that another rule completely shadows is not a
 * tie-break, it is dead code.
 *
 * WHY SPENDING THE SMALL EXPIRING ACCOUNT IS STILL RIGHT. Credits are fungible, so
 * using the rich account instead does not preserve the 1 point — it spends the 1
 * point's chance and loses it. Using the expiring account spends a point that was
 * going to be lost anyway, and the rich account is still there for the next
 * request. The only real cost is a failover round-trip if the expiring account
 * cannot cover a whole request, which the exclusion/failover path already absorbs.
 *
 * Excluded accounts are still RETURNED (sorted after the candidates) so the card
 * can explain why each is out; they differ from candidates by `excludedBy` being
 * set, never by being silently dropped.
 *
 * Pure and total: the same input always yields the same order, and it never throws
 * on missing data (an account with no credits is ranked as 0, not crashed on).
